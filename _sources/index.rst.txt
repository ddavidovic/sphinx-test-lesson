Workshop on the practical use of HPC systems
==========================================

The workshop is dedicated to supporting researchers who utilize computer clusters and 
high-performance computing systems as part of their daily tasks. Its primary goal is 
to enhance their proficiency in utilizing these systems efficiently, thereby boosting 
productivity and reducing the time needed to prepare, execute, and analyze their workflows 
on remote computing platforms.

   Who is the course for?
   ----------------------

   The workshop is for young researchers, postdocs, experience researchers and developers/technician having need to use or are already using 
   large computer cluster to perform their advanced calculations, run simulations and analyse results. 


   About the workshop
   ------------------

   The workshop is organized as a one-day event divided into 3 topics: Introduction to work in the cluster environment, JUBE benchmarking tool and Julia programming
   language for HPC. It is not obligatory to attend all 3 topics, the learners can choose which topics (or all of them) to attend. 

   The workshop is structured as a one-day event, covering four distinct topics: 
   an introduction to high-performance computing, working in a cluster environment, the JUBE benchmarking tool, 
   and programming with the Julia language for high-performance computing. 
   Attendance at all four topics is not mandatory; learners have the flexibility to choose the specific 
   topics they wish to attend.
