# Available infrastructures

Supercomputers are substantial and costly machines utilized across academia, industry, business, and the military, playing an increasingly strategic role. Currently, a fierce competition exists between the USA and China in terms of the number of installed HPC systems and their computational power, with Europe trailing behind these two leaders.

The list of the world's fastest supercomputers can be found in the renowned **[Top500](https://www.top500.org/lists/top500/2024/11/)** list, which is updated twice a year (in June and November). This list provides comprehensive technical details and statistics for the available systems, encompassing computing systems from both academic and private sectors. The ranking is based on the achieved performance (measured in PFLOPS) using the **[LINPACK Benchmark](https://www.netlib.org/benchmark/hpl/)** for distributed-memory LU factorization with partial pivoting in double-precision arithmetic.

An additional metric for ranking HPC systems is the **[High-Performance Conjugate Gradients (HPCG)](https://www.hpcg-benchmark.org/)** benchmark. This benchmark is designed to evaluate computational and data access patterns that closely align with a wide range of significant applications, assessing performance in areas that the LINPACK benchmark may not fully address.

## Fairsharing access policy

The majority of the supercomputers apply the fairsharing policy. It is the resource allocation policy or mechanism that aims to distribute computing resources fairly among multiple users or user groups. The objective of a fairshare policy is to ensure that each user or group receives a proportional share of the supercomputer's resources, such as CPU time, memory, or storage capacity, based on their needs and priorities.

```{callout} No exlusive allocation of resources!
Individual users or user groups do not have exclusive access to specific resources like CPUs, GPUs, or memory. Instead, they are allocated computational time on these resources, ensuring that the physical resources are fairly shared with other users of the computing system.

## Local HPC systems (EDIH AI4Health.CRO)

A local GPU cluster **[ORTHUS](https://hybridscale.github.io/orthus/index)** located at the Ruđer Bošković Institute, in Zagreb. The systems comprises of a frontend and a compute node, armed with 2 Intel Xeon Gold processors (providing a total of 48 computing cores), 4 NVIDIA A100 GPUs, 512 GB of main memory, and 60TB of storage. The system operates on the CentOS7 operating system and utilizes the SGE queuing system.

Orhus primarily serves as a local platform for tasks such as code development, testing, proof-of-concept endeavors, and conducting smaller-scale analyses and simulations.

```{challenge} How to access?
Access to the cluster is limited to the RBI network for security purposes and can be achieved through two methods:
- Remote connection from within the RBI network.
- Remote connection from outside the RBI network via a VPN connection.

To request access, please send an email to [orthus-info@irb.hr](mailto:orthus-info@irb.hr)

## HPC systems in Croatia

### BURA (Univ. of Rijeka)

The first supercomputer in Croatia was [BURA](https://cnrm.uniri.hr/bura/) located at the Centre for Advanced Computing and Modelling (CNRM) at the University of Rijeka. The application of Bura is for advanced modeling and optimization in the fields of biotechnology, biomedicine, nanoscience, physics and other branches of science and industry.

The supercomputer is a hybrid computing system consisting of three main parts:
- **Cluster**: the multicomputer system consisting of 288 compute nodes each equipped with two Intel Xeon E5 processors (24 cores per node). A total of 6912 processor cores and 18 TB of (distributed) main memory.
- **GPGPU**: 4 heterogeneous nodes each with two NVIDIA Tesla K40 general purpose GPUs.
- **SMP**: 2 multiprocessor nodes with a large amount of shared memory (6 TB main memory and 245 TB of local storage).

```{figure} ../img/CNRM_Bura.png

```

The system has a wide range of pre-installed open-source and proprietary software. You can access the comprehensive list of these software packages [here](https://cnrm.uniri.hr/software/).

```{challenge} Some facts
- Acquired in 2015.
- #441 at TOP500 (287 TFLOPS) at the time of installation
- 288 compute nodes
- 6912 processing cores
- 17 TB main memory
- 95 TB storage​
```

```{challenge} How to access?
The Bura supercomputer is primarly intended for academic use, but access can also be granted to industry/SME. The request can be made by filling in the online [form](https://cnrm.uniri.hr/contact/).

Typically, an initial **trial period of up to one month** is provided, after which the industry or SME is expected to cover resource usage costs based on the core-hours. The total resource allocation (and price) are negotiate individually per-user with the system provider (CNRM - UNIRI).
